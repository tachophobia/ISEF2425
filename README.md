# Lichtenberg Figures as a Metaheuristic for Balancing the Explore-Exploit Tradeoff in Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of Lichtenberg Figures as a metaheuristic for improving the balance between exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning (RL). The goal is to enhance the rate of convergence and stability of RL algorithms, particularly in environments with continuous action spaces. The research compares the performance of a Lichtenberg-inspired algorithm to established RL techniques, such as epsilon-greedy and UCB, through empirical evaluation and analysis.
